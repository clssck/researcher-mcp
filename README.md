# MCP-researcher Server

Your own research assistant inside of Cline! Utilizes Perplexity's new Sonar Pro API to get docs, create up-to-date api routes, and check deprecated code while you create features with Cline. 

Includes Chain of Thought Reasoning and local chat history through SQLite thanks to Lix for the idea :)

## Tools

### 1. [Search](https://github.com/DaInfernalCoder/researcher-mcp/blob/main/examples/search.md)
Performs general search queries to get comprehensive information on any topic. The example shows how to use different detail levels (brief, normal, detailed) to get tailored responses.

### 2. [Get Documentation](https://github.com/DaInfernalCoder/researcher-mcp/blob/main/examples/find-apis.md)
Retrieves documentation and usage examples for specific technologies, libraries, or APIs. The example demonstrates getting comprehensive documentation for React hooks, including best practices and common pitfalls.

### 3. [Find APIs](https://github.com/DaInfernalCoder/researcher-mcp/blob/main/examples/find-apis.md)
Discovers and evaluates APIs that could be integrated into a project. The example shows finding payment processing APIs with detailed analysis of features, pricing, and integration complexity.

### 4. [Check Deprecated Code](https://github.com/DaInfernalCoder/researcher-mcp/blob/main/examples/check-deprecated-code.md)
Analyzes code for deprecated features or patterns, providing migration guidance. The example demonstrates checking React class components and lifecycle methods for modern alternatives.


## Installation

### paste this part into claude directly if you want to, the ai can install it for you

1. First install Node.js if not already installed (from nodejs.org)

2. Clone the repo

- git clone https://github.com/DaInfernalCoder/researcher-mcp perplexity-server 

- cd perplexity-server

3. Install dependencies and build:
npm install

4. Get a Perplexity API key from [https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)

5. Create the MCP settings file in the appropriate location for your OS:
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
Windows: %APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json
Linux: ~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json

5. To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

6. To use with Cline, add into mcpServers: 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "[path/to/researcher-mcp/index.js]"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": ""
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "search",
        "get_documentation",
        "find_apis",
        "check_deprecated_code"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

7. Build the server: 
npm run build

Make sure to:
- Replace /absolute/path/to with the actual path where you cloned the repository
- Replace your-api-key-here with your Perplexity API key
- Keep the same autoApprove settings for consistent behavior
